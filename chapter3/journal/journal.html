    So, I've already traveled 1200 miles and visited some interesting plces:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Walla Walla,WA</li>
    <li>Magic City,ID</li>
    <li>Bountiful,UT</li>
    <li>Last Chance,CO</li>
    <li>Truth or Consequences,NM</li>
    <li>Why,AZ</li>
</ol>

    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Passing cars,<br>
    When you can't see,<br>
    May get you,<br>
    A glimpse,<br>
    Of eternity.<br>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything
    packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to
    bring a whole lot with me:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>cellphone</li>
    <li>iPod</li>
    <li>digital camera</li>
    <li>protein bar</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As Lao Tzu would have said <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
